# Malaria-Detection
* Malaria parasites can be identified by examining malaria cell images under the microscope, A drop of the patient’s blood spreads out as a “blood smear” on a microscope slide. Prior to examination, the specimen is stained to give the parasites a distinctive appearance.
* WHO recommends that all cases of suspected malaria be confirmed using parasite-based diagnostic testing (either microscopy or rapid diagnostic test) before administering treatment. Results of parasitological confirmation can be available in 30 minutes or less
# Technology Stack
* programming languages & library: python,matplotlib,scikit-learn,keras
* Web-Technologies: HTML,CSS
* Web-framework:flask
* Miscellaneous :Anaconda,jupyter notebook,spyder

# steps to run the application
* Clone the repository
* Run the ipython notebook, train and download the trained model in h5py file
* Up the backend server by navigating to flask and running app.py python file
* The front-end server uses the HTML template and redirects to http://127.0.0.1:5000

# Note 
* I have reduced the total no of images and made a seperate zipfile so that the model takes less time to train without a GPU box.
* people can use the actual dataset as well 
* seperate environment setup is expected to follow
